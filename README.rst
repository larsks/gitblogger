What it is, yo?
===============

Gitblogger lets you write blog entries in reStructuredText_ (RST) and posts
(or updates) them automatically to a Blogger blog when you push them to a
repository.

And why would you want to do that?
==================================

Maybe you don't?  I don't know.

I don't think that anyone should have to write HTML, and RST is my
preferred lightweight markup language.  I'm also a fan of version control
in general and git_ in particular.  I like being able to track my changes
over time, I like using a `real editor`_ on my posts, and I like having
things happen with the smallest amount of manual intervention possibe.
